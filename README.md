# FCC-Responsive-Web-Design-Projects
This is my completed responsive web design projects from FreeCodeCamp.

A quick disclaimer.
I don't know how to code, I have never done it, never felt I'm going to code anytime soon in my life, I thought it was something similar to building a rocket where I need to know a lot of math and then I switch to learning how to code about ~19 days ago (at a time I'm writing this). 

GG WP. 
I'm really loving it.

___________
Everything in this projects was done by trial and error without really knowing what is going on at core. 
This will be learned step-by-step from now on. Just so I understand what is actually happening under the hood to give a better picture.
Everything is how would you expect - a bit (or not a bit) clunky :)

Info about projects:
- There're 5 projects in total from Responsive web design block.
- Projects are aimed at plain CSS and HTML. That's what I used in all of them. No BootStrap, Tailwind CSS, or something else.
- Every project have a number of test's that I need to pass via script provided by FCC (links below to codepen.io)
- Every project was "styled" however I wanted. I'm not a designer, take this in mind.
- In every project, I tried to make a bit more challenges for myself to try thins out. Create a transition, loop animation, stuff like that to make it "fancy".

Codepen projects (you can run the script to see if it's passing all user stories): 
1. Tribute page - https://codepen.io/dimitryzub/pen/LYbQdPG
2. Survey form - https://codepen.io/dimitryzub/pen/wvorqmq
3. Product landing page - https://codepen.io/dimitryzub/pen/yLVzomG
4. Technical documentation - https://codepen.io/dimitryzub/pen/oNYpNYG
It's really interesting, because I wrote directly to	Alexander Medvednikov via Discord with words "oh hey there! I wrote a fan documentation about you language. Just so you know." And he replied to me with kind words. Thanks to my wonderful brother Ilya Zub :)
Have no idea what I was trying to say wtih this. Interesting experience.

Deployed 5 projects to Vercel:
1. Tribute page - https://tribute-page-flame.vercel.app
2. Survey form - https://survey-form-theta.vercel.app (on vercel, top text elements looks correct in comparison to codepen. Currently I don't understand this behavior.)
3. Product landing page - https://product-landing-page-six.vercel.app
4. Technical documentation - https://technical-documentation-mu.vercel.app
5. Personal portfolio - https://portfolio-webpage-mocha.vercel.app

(it's much faster to see them via links above rather than going through the "environments" tab (there's is a bit messy, tried to understand how things work)
