# FCC-Responsive-Web-Design-Projects
This is my completed responsive web design projects from FreeCodeCamp.

A quick disclaimer. 
I don't know how to code, I never done it, never feel I'm going to code anytime soon in my life, thought it's something similar to building a rocket and then I switch to learning it ~19 days ago (at a time I'm wrting this). GG WP. And I'm really loving it.

___________
Everything in this projects was done by trial and error without really knowing what is going on at core (kinda often). 
This will be learned step-by-step from now on. Just so I understand what is actually happening under the hood to give a better picture.
Everything is how would you expect - a bit (or not a bit) clunky :)

Info about projects:
- There're 5 projects in total.
- Projects are aimed to plain CSS and HTML. That's what I used in all of them. No BootStrap, TailWind CSS or something else.
- Every project have a number of test's that I need to pass via script provided by FCC (linked via codepen.io)
- Every project was "styled" however I wanted. I'm not a designer, take this in mind.
- In every project I tried to make a bit more challanges for myself to try thins out. Create a transition, loop animation, stuff like that to make it     "fancy" which is funny to me.

It's really interesting, because I wrote directly to	Alexander Medvednikov via Discord with words "oh hey there! I wrote a fan documentation about you language. Just so you know." And he replied to me with kind words. Thanks to my brother Ilya Zub :)
Have no idea what I was trying to say wtih this. Interesting experience.
